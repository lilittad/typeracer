# Typeracer

This game is aimed to improve your typing skills by measuring current progress and reviewing history of previous games.

## Implementation

### Browser compatibility

Application works on latest browsers, as the most fancy features of html/css/js are used for developing this nice game. So time to update your browser :P

### Public APIs

For getting random racing text, https://baconipsum.com/json-api/ Api is used.
Fot saving user's score and getting history, https://api.myjson.com/bins is used

### WPM algorithm

Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each
"word" is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English,[1] including spaces and punctuation
WPM = ((All entries/5)/Time(m))

### Installation

To run application locally please do following in your terminal
- npm install
- npm start

### Usage

After running commands, http://localhost:3000/ should be opened in your default browser. Login and enjoy the game.
