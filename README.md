## Implementation

### Public APIs

For getting random racing text, https://baconipsum.com/json-api/ Api is used.

### WPM algorithm
Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each
"word" is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English,[1] including spaces and punctuation
WPM = ((All entries/5)/Time(m))
